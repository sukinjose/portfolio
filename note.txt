Elements with display: inline behave like textâ€”they only take up as much width as needed and don't disrupt the flow of surrounding content. However, there are some limitations:
Margins and Padding: For inline elements, vertical margins (top and bottom) and padding are generally ignored, meaning they won't create any space above or below the element. Only horizontal margins and padding (left and right) work properly.
Setting Width/Height: Inline elements can't have their width or height explicitly set. They automatically take up as much width as their content requires.

The Benefit of display: inline-block
When you change an element's display to inline-block, it behaves like an inline element in terms of flowing with text but also gains the characteristics of a block-level element:
Respects Vertical Margins and Padding: Unlike inline elements, inline-block elements respect top and bottom margins and padding. This is why, after setting an element to inline-block, you can use margin-bottom, padding-top, etc., and see the expected spacing.
Can Set Width and Height: You can explicitly define the width and height of an inline-block element, which isn't possible with purely inline elements.


what will you do if you ur content is crossing across the page then you have to go for the overflow?
overfow:hidden ; >>>> is used to create omit the content outside the page.
